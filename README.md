# Anime-Recommendations-Deployment

## Introduction

After completing my project on creating an [anime recommendation system](https://github.com/Zenoix/Anime-Recommendations-Model-Creation), I thought that it would be a good idea to learn some web development so I would be able to learn some skills related to deploying data science models. So this is my first proper go at learning web dev with this repo containing the source code files for my deployment website of my recommendation system and my progress through learning web dev.

## What I've Learnt
- The very basics of HTML and CSS
- Implementing a basic light/dark theme site that is toggleable
